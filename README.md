# 🤖 Python LLM Analytics Pipeline (LangChain + Mistral)

## 📘 Overview

This project walks through the setup and execution of a full **LLM pipeline** using:

* [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
* [Mistral 7B model](https://mistral.ai/)
* [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (local LLM deployment)
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* BLEU scoring for generated text accuracy

The notebook was created in Google Colab and demonstrates how to:

* Spin up LLM infrastructure (via `xterm` and Ollama)
* Query an LLM using LangChain
* Analyze LLM-generated responses using natural language processing techniques
* Evaluate model performance using sentiment, part-of-speech tagging, and BLEU score

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

| Feature                          | Description                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompting & Chain-of-Thought** | LLM is primed using structured templates (`Let's think step by step`) |
| **LangChain Integration**        | Pipeline sends inputs to Mistral and captures responses               |
| **NLTK Analysis**                | Sentiment scoring, tokenization, frequency distribution               |
| **BLEU Score Evaluation**        | Quantitative scoring of LLM accuracy using reference Wikipedia data   |

## 🔍 Why It Matters

This project highlights how to:

* Design and analyze LLM behavior in a structured, repeatable way
* Use open-source tools to simulate AI interaction in low-resource environments
* Extend NLP skills into the modern LLM landscape for applied product testing, data validation, and content quality control
